# 7.13 
don't have too much time so i'm just creating this documentation for the soa migration/scaffolding/whatever verb i might wanna use here. Starting off by creating the 
`sh` 
service-manager.ts 

from there I'll try and just create the basic classes for workouts to get the ball rolling. 

I first define two interfaces for the data that is leaving workouts.ts, the data within each workout, and all the workouts themselves

NEXT STEPS: write all of the member functions that will be the same as all of the request handlers, except just not taking the requests themselves.
